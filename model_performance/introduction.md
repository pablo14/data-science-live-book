### What is this about?

It covers **methodological aspects of the error** in predictive models, how to measure it through **cross-validation** data and its similitude with **bootstrapping** technique. And how these strategies are used internally by some predictive models such us _random forest_ or _gradient boosting machines_.

There is also a chapter about how to validate models when time is involved, which is similar to classical train/test validation.

#### Regarding predictive models with the multi-label outcome...

There is a chapter about gain and lift quality measures, which gives light to one important aspect when evaluation these models: to be sure the model correctly orders the cases according to their propensity to belong to the specific label.

Related to this point, it's recommended to read the <a href="http://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/scoring/scoring.html">Scoring Data</a> chapter, as a complement to the validation techniques.
