Correlation table against target variable
=====

### What is this about?

It retrieves the well known `R statistic` -which measures **linear** correlation  for all numeric variables _(skipping the string ones)_.


```{r ,results="hide", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(base.dir = "selecting_best_variables")
```

```{r}
correlation_table(data=heart_disease, str_target="has_heart_disease")
```

`R statistic` goes from `1` _positive correlation_ to `-1` _negative correlation_. A value around `0` implies no correlation.
Squaring this number returns the `R squared` statistic (aka `R2`), which goes from `0` _no correlation_ to `1` _high correlation_. 

### C.1) R2 bias problem

**R statistic is highly influenced by outliers and non-linear relationships.**

Outliers can be treated with `prep_outliers` function, present in this package.

Take a look at the **Anscombe's quartet**. These 4 relationships are quite different, but all of them have the same R2: 0.816.


```{r, out.width = 400, fig.retina = NULL, echo=F}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("anscombe_quartet.png")
```
