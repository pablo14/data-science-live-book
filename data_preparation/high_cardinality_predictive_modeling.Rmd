### What is this about?

As we've seen in the other chapter (<a href="http://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/data_preparation/high_cardinality_descriptive_stats.html" target="blank">Reducing categories in descriptive stats</a>) we keep the categories with the major representativeness, but how about having another variable to predict with it? That is, to predict `has_flu` based on `country`.

Using the last method may destroy the information of the variable, thus it **loses predictive power**. In this chapter we'll go further in the method described above, using an automatic grouping function -`auto_grouping`- surfing through the variable's structure, giving some ideas about how to optimize a categorical variable, but more importantly: encouraging the reader to perform her-his own optimizations.

Other literature named this re-grouping as cardinality reduction or **encoding**.

<br>

**What are we going to review in this chapter?**

* Concept of representativeness of data (sample size).
* Sample size having a target or outcome variable.
* From R: Present a method to help reduce cardinality and profiling categoric variable.
* A practical before-and-after example reducing cardinality and insights extraction.
* How different models such as random forest or a gradient boosting machine deals with categorical variables.

<br>

### But is it necessary to re-group the variable?

It depends on the case, but the quickest answer is yes. In this chapter we will see one case in which this data preparation increases overall accuracy (measuring by the Area Under Roc Curve).

There is a tradeoff between the **representation of the data** (how many rows each category has), and how is each category related to the outcome variable. E.g.: some countries are more prone to cases of flu than others


```{r , message=F}
# Loading funModeling >=1.6 which contains functions to deal with this. 
library(funModeling)
library(dplyr)
```

Profiling `data_country`, which comes inside `funModeling` package (please update to release 1.6).

Quick `data_country` profiling (first 10 rows)

```{r high_cardinality_variable,  fig.height=8, fig.width=4}
# plotting first 10 rows
head(data_country, 10)

# exploring data, displaying only first 10 rows
head(freq(data_country, "country"), 10)
```

```{r data_preparation_high_cardinality_variable, fig.height=3}
# exploring data
freq(data_country, "has_flu")
```


<br>

### The case 🔎

The predictive model will try to map certain values with certain outcomes, in our case the target variable is binary.

We'll computed a complete profiling of `country` regarding the target variable `has_flu` based on `categ_analysis`. 

Each row represent an unique category of `input` variables. Withing each row you can find attributes that define each category in terms of representativeness and likelihood. 


```{r, results='hide'}
## `categ_analysis` is available in "funModeling" >= v1.6, please install it before using it.
country_profiling=categ_analysis(data=data_country, input="country", target = "has_flu")

## Printing first 40 rows (countries) out of 70.
head(country_profiling, 40)
```

<img src="country_profiling.png" alt="profiling country for predictive modeling">

<br>

* Note 1: _The first column automatically adjusts its name based on `input` variable_
* Note 2: _`has_flu` variable has values `yes` and `no`, `categ_analysis` assigns internally the number **1** to the less representative class, `yes` in this case, in order to calculate the mean, sum and percentage._

These are the metrics returned by `categ_analysis`:

* `country`: name of each category in `input` variable.
* `mean_target`: `sum_target/q_rows`, average number of `has_flu="yes"` for that category. This is the likelihood.
* `sum_target`: quantity of `has_flu="yes"` values are in each category.
* `perc_target`: the same as `sum_target` but in percentage,  `sum_target of each category / total sum_target`. This column sums `1.00`.
* `q_rows`: quantity of rows that, regardless of the `has_flu` variable, fell in that category. It's the distribution of `input`. This column sums the total rows analyzed.
* `perc_rows`: related to `q_rows` it represents the share or percentage of each category. This column sums `1.00`

<br>

#### What conclusions can we draw from this?

Reading example based on 1st row, `France`:

* 41 people have flu (`sum_target=41`). These 41 people represent almost 50% of the total people having flu (`perc_target=0.494`).
* Likelihood of having flu in France is 14.2% (`mean_target=0.142`)
* Total rows from France=288 -out of 910-. This is the `q_rows` variable; `perc_rows` is the same number but in percentage.

Without considering the filter by country, we've got:

* Column `sum_target` sums the total people with flu present in data.
* Column `perc_target` sums `1.00` -or 100%
* Column `q_rows` sums total rows present in `data_country` data frame.
* Column `perc_rows` sums `1.00` -or 100%.

### Analysis for Predictive Modeling 🔮

When developing predictive models, we may be interested in those values which increases the likelihood of a certain event. In our case:

**What are the countries that  maximize the likelihood of finding people with flu?**

Easy, take `country_profiling` in a descending order by `mean_target`:

```{r}
# Ordering country_profiling by mean_target and then take the first 6 countries
arrange(country_profiling, -mean_target) %>%  head(.)
```

<br>

Great! We've got `Malasyia` as the country with the highest likelihood to have flu! 100% of people there have flu (`mean_has_flu=1.000`).

But our common sense advises us that _perhaps_ something is wrong...

How many rows does Malasya have? Answer: 1. -column: `q_rows=1`
How many positive cases does Malasya have? Answer: 1 -column: `sum_target=1`

Since the sample cannot be increased see if this proportion stays high, it will contribute to **overfit** and create a bias on the predictive model.

How about `Mexico`? 2 out of 3 have flu... it still seems low. However `Uruguay` has 17.3% likelihood -11 out of 63 cases- and these 63 cases represents almost 7% of total population (`perc_row=0.069`), this ratio seems more credible.

Next there are some ideas to treat this:

---

#### Case 1: Reducing by re-categorizing less representative values

Keep all cases with at least certain percentage of representation in data. Let's say to rename the countries that have less than 1% of presence in data to `others`.

```{r}
country_profiling=categ_analysis(data=data_country, input="country", target = "has_flu")

countries_high_rep=filter(country_profiling, perc_rows>0.01) %>% .$country

## If not in countries_high_rep then assign `other` category
data_country$country_new=ifelse(data_country$country %in% countries_high_rep, data_country$country, "other")

```

Checking again the likelihood:

```{r}
country_profiling_new=categ_analysis(data=data_country, input="country_new", target = "has_flu")
country_profiling_new
```

We've reduced the quantity of countries drastically -**74% less**- only by shrinking the less representative at 1%. Obtaining 18 out of 70 countries.

Likelihood of target variable has been stabilised a little more in `other` category. Now when the predictive model _sees_ `Malasya`  it will **not assign 100% of likelihood, but 4.1%** (`mean_has_flu=0.041`).

**Advice about this last method:**

Watch out about applying this technique blindly. Sometimes in a **highly unbalanced** target prediction -e.g. **anomaly detection**- the abnormal behavior is present in less than 1% of cases.

```{r}
# replicating the data
d_abnormal=data_country

# simulating abnormal behavior with some countries
d_abnormal$abnormal=ifelse(d_abnormal$country %in% c("Brazil", "Chile"), 'yes', 'no')

# categorical analysis
ab_analysis=categ_analysis(d_abnormal, input = "country", target = "abnormal")

## displaying only first 6 elements
head(ab_analysis)

# inspecting distributrion, just a few belongs to ' 'no' categoryreq(d_abnormal, "abnormal", plot = F)
```

_How many abnormal values are there?_

Only 15, and they represent 1.65% of total values.

Checking the table returned by `categ_analysis`, we can see that this _abnormal behavior_ occurs **only**  in categories with a really low participation: `Brazil` which is present in only 1.4% of cases, and `Chile` with 0.2%.

Creating a category `other` based on the distribution is not a good idea here.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the fact this is a prepared example, there are some data preparations techniques that can be really useful in terms of accuracy, but they need some supervision. This supervision can be helped by algorithms.

<br>

#### Case 2: Reducing by automatic grouping

This procedure uses the `kmeans` clustering technique and the table returned by `categ_analysis` in order to create groups -clusters- which contain categories which exhibit similar behavior in terms of:

* `sum_target`
* `mean_target`
* `perc_rows`

The combination of all of them will lead to find groups considering likelihood and representativeness.


**Hands on R:**

We define the `n_groups` parameter, it's the number of desired groups. The number is relative to the data and the number of total categories. But a general number would be between 3 and 10.

Function `auto_grouping` comes in `funModeling` >=1.6. Please note that the `target` parameter only supports for now binary variables.

_Note: the `seed` parameter is optional, but assigning a number will retrieve always the same results._

```{r}
## Reducing the cardinality
country_groups=auto_grouping(data = data_country, input = "country", target="has_flu", n_groups=8, seed = 999)
country_groups$df_equivalence
```

`auto_grouping` returns a list containing 3 objects:

* `df_equivalence`: data frame which contains a table to map old to new values.
* `fit_cluster`: k-means model used to reduce the cardinality (values are scaled).
* `recateg_results`: data frame containing the profiling of each group regarding target variable, first column adjusts its name to the input variable in this case we've got: `country_rec`. Each group correspond to one or many cainput's categoriesariable (as seen in `df_equivalence`).

Let's explore how the new groups behave, this is what the predictive model will _see_:

```{r}
country_groups$recateg_results
```

Last table is ordered by mean_target, so we can quickly see groups maximizing and minimizing the likelihood.

_We'll leave `group_5` to the end._

* `group_3` is the most common, it is present in 31.6% of cases and mean_target (likelihood) is 14.2%.
* Excluding `group_5` for now, `group_4` has the highest likelihood, while `group_8` has the lowest. Both have good representativeness: 11.9 and 14.7 of all input rows.
* `group_6` and `group_8` are pretty similar, they can be one group since likelihood is 0 in both cases.

**What about `group_5`?**

We see that is the group with the most likelihood, 75% `has_flu`. This is a cluster of outliers, here are the categories with low-representativeness and high likelihood. `Malasia` and `Mexico` are there.

If we are more conscious about false positives, we can consider that this group doesn't have enough information and assign it to `group_8`, so it will have no influence in increasing the likelihood of predicting flu (`mean_target=0`). Or, we can assign to an average group like `group_3`.


```{r, message=F}
data_country=data_country %>% inner_join(country_groups$df_equivalence)
```
Now we do the additional transformations replacing:
`group_5` by `group_3`; and `group_6` by `group_8`.

```{r, hide=T}
data_country$country_rec=ifelse(data_country$country_rec == "group_5", "group_3", data_country$country_rec)
data_country$country_rec=ifelse(data_country$country_rec == "group_6", "group_8", data_country$country_rec)
```

Checking the final grouping (`country_rec` variable):
```{r}
categ_analysis(data=data_country, input="country_rec", target = "has_flu")
```

Now each group seems to have a good sample size, and values `mean_target` shows a decreasing pattern where each doesn't appear to be so high and is well distributed in the `0.176` to `0` range. [1]

<br>

 
### Handling new categories when the predictive model is on production

Let's imagine a new country appears, `new_country_hello_world`, predictive models will fail since they were trained with fixed values. One technique is to assign a group which has `mean_target=0`.

It's similar to the case in last example. But the difference lies in `group_5`, this category would fit better in a mid-likelihood group than a complete new value.

After some time we should re-build the model with all new values, otherwise we would be penalizing `new_country_hello_world` if it has a good likelihood.

In so many words:

_A new category appears? Send to the least meaningful group. After a while, re-analyze its impact. Does it have a mid or high likelihood? Change it to the most suitable group._

### Do predictive models handle high cardinality? Part 1

We're going throught this by building two predictive models: Gradient Boosting Machine -quite robust across many different data inputs.

The first model doesn't have treated data, and the second one has been treated by the function in `funModeling` package.

We're measuring the precision based on ROC area, ranged from 0.5 to 1, the higher the number the better the model is. We are going to use cross-validation to be _sure_ about the value. The importance of cross-validate results is treated in <a href="http://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/model_performance/knowing_the_error.html" target="blank">Knowing the error</a> chapter.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
## Building the first model, without reducing cardinality.
library(caret)
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                           number = 4,
                           classProbs = TRUE,
                           summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)


fit_gbm_1 <- train(has_flu ~ country,
                   data = data_country,
                   method = "gbm",
                   trControl = fitControl,
                   verbose = FALSE,
                   metric = "ROC")


```

```{r}
roc=round(mean(fit_gbm_1$results$ROC),2)
sprintf("Area under ROC curve is: %s", roc)
```

Now we do the same model with the same parameters, but with the data preparation we did before.

<br>
  
```{r, hide=T, echo=F}
## Building the second model, country_group is based on country.
fit_gbm_2 <- train(has_flu ~ country_rec,
                   data = data_country,
                   method = "gbm",
                   trControl = fitControl,
                   verbose = FALSE,
                   metric = "ROC")

```

```{r}
new_roc=round(mean(fit_gbm_2$results$ROC),2)
sprintf("New ROC value is: %s", new_roc);
```

Then we alculate the percentage of improvement over first roc value:
  
```{r}
sprintf("Improvement: ~ %s%%", round(100*(new_roc-roc)/roc,2));
```

Not too bad, right?

**A short comment about last test:**

We've used one of the most robust models, **gradient boosting machine**, and we've increased the performance. If we try other model, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression" target="blank">logistic regression</a>, which is more sensible to dirty data, we'll get a higher difference between reducing and not reducing cardinality. This can be checked deleting `verbose=FALSE` parameter and changing `method=glm` (`glm` implies logistic regression).

In _further reading_ there is a benchmark of different treatments for categorical variables and how each one increases or decreases the accuracy.

<br>

### Don't predictive models handle high cardinality? Part 2

Let's review how some models deal with this:

**Decision Trees**: Tend to select variables with high cardinality at the top, thus giving more importance above others, based on the information gain. In practise, it is evidence of overfitting. This model is good to see the difference between reducing or not a high cardinality variable.

**Random Forest** -at least in R implementation- handles only categorical variables with at least 52 different categories. It's highly probable that this limitation is to avoid overfitting. This point in conjunction to the nature of the algorithm -creates lots of trees- reduces the effect of a single decision tree when choosing a high cardinality variable.

**Gradient Boosting Machine** and **Logistic Regression** converts internally categorical variables into flag or dummy variables. In the example we saw about countries, it implies the -internal- creation of 70 flag variables. Checking the model we created before:

```{r}
# Checking the first model...
fit_gbm_1$finalModel
```

That is: 69 input variables are representing the countries, but the flag columns were reported as not being relevant to make the prediction. 


This opens a new chapter which is going to be covered in this book 😉: **Feature engineering** or **selecting best variables**. It is a highly recommended practise to first select those variables which carry the most information, and then create the predictive model.

**Conclusion: reducing the cardinality will reduce the quantity of variables in these models.**

<br>

### Numerical or multi-nominal target variable 📏

The book covered only the target as a binary variable, it is planned in the future to cover numerical and multi-value target.

However, if you read up to here, you may want explore on your own having the same idea in mind. In numerical variables, for example forecasting `page visits` on a web site, there will be certain categories of the input variable that which will be more related with a high value on visits, while there are others that are more correlated with low values.

The same goes for multi-nominal output variable, there will be some categories more related to certain values. For example predicting the epidemic degree: `high`, `mid` or `low` based on the city. There will be some cities that correlated more correlated with a high epidemic level than others.

<br>

### What we've got as an "extra-🎁"  from the grouping?

Knowing how categories fell into groups give us information that -in some cases- is good to report. Each category between the group will share similar behavior -in terms of representativeness and prediction power-.

If `Argentine` and `Chile` are in `group_1`, then they are the same, and this is how the model will _see_ it.

<br>

### Representativeness or sample size

This concept is on the analysis of any categorical variable, but it's a very common topic in data science and statistics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination" target="blank">**sample size**</a>. How much data is it needed to see the pattern _well developed?_.

In a categorical variable: How many cases of category "`X`" do we need to trust in the correlation between "`X`" value and a target value? This is what we've analyzed.

In general terms: the more difficult the event to predict, the more cases we need...

Further in this book we'll cover this topic from other points of view linking back to this page.

<br>

### Final thoughts

* We saw two cases to reduce cardinality, the first one doesn't care about the target variable, which can be dangerous in a predictive model, while the second one does. It creates a new variable based on the affinity -and representativity- of each input category to the target variable.

* Key concept: **representativeness** of each category regarding itself, and regarding to the event being predicted.

* What was mentioned in the beginning in respects to **destroying the information in the input variable**, implies that the resultant grouping have the same rates across groups (in a binary variable input). [1]

* _Should we always reduce the cardinality?_ It depends, two tests on a simple data are not enough to extrapolate all cases. Hopefully it will be a good kick-off for the reader to start doing her-his own optimizations.
